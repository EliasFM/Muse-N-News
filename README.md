## Entertainment Searching via iTunes 
This web app uses the iTunes API to let users query media based on a keyword. It looks for music, movies, and audiobooks. Clicking on the searched items can lead you to articles about the current topic at hand (more on this later).

### Features
Users can use the search bar to look for their media. They can use the `type` dropdown to look for the specific kind of media. Additionally, users can also add favorites, which can be viewed in the `favorites` tab.

#### Contributions
This website was created by Elias Mendel, Yulong Tan, Katie Clark, and Anushka Raheja.
